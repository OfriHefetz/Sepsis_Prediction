## What is sepsis?**
Sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency caused by your body’s overwhelming response to an infection. 
Without urgent treatment, it can lead to tissue damage, organ failure and death.

## Sepsis definition
Sepsis is your body’s extreme reaction to an infection. When you have an infection, your immune system works to try to fight it.
But sometimes your immune system stops fighting the infection and starts damaging your normal tissues and organs, leading to widespread 
inflammation throughout your body.
At the same time, an abnormal chain reaction in your clotting system can cause blood clots to form in your blood vessels. 
This reduces blood flow to the different organs of your body and can cause significant damage or even failure.

## How common is sepsis?
More than 1.7 million people in the United States receive a diagnosis of sepsis each year. There are differences in sepsis rates among different demographic groups. Sepsis is more common among older adults, with incidence increasing with each year after the age of 65 years old.
